✅ Clean, correct PV manifest (what you should apply)

apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: tiger-pv
spec:
  capacity:
    storage: 1Gi
  accessModes:
    - ReadOnlyMany
  nfs:
    server: 172.17.0.2
    path: /tmp
  persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: Retain
  storageClassName: slow
  volumeMode: Filesystem


Apply it with:

oc apply -f tiger-pv.yaml

✅ Bind PVC to your existing tiger-pv (manual PV)
Corrected PVC (matches your PV)

apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: tiger-pvc
  namespace: default
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadOnlyMany
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 1Gi
  storageClassName: slow
  volumeMode: Filesystem


Apply:

oc delete pvc tiger-pvc
oc apply -f tiger-pvc.yaml


✔️ This will bind immediately
